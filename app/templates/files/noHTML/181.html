LATE SIGNPOSTS POINT WAY TOWARD INDUSTRY TRENDS OF 

Executive Summary From interviews with industry leaders and analysis
of recent events it is possible to connect some of the dots and make
educated guesses about what  holds in store for wireless

 The way Larry Vanston sees it the year ahead will be a lot like
 in the world of wireless telecommunications This is to say that
 will be another year of recordsetting growth heightened
competition and rapid technological change for the industry
according to Vanston president of Austin Texasbased consultants
Technology Futures Inc
 Vanston and other observers surveyed by WBF said it may well be
that the industry is in for a year when the pace of developments if
anything gains more momentum Such an acceleration is seen occurring
across a broad frontmanifested by prices for services driven lower
as more competitors arrive on the scene and by a stream of
technological advancesand against a backdrop where wireless
telephony becomes a widespread reality in more markets overseas
 But this is not to say that there are no clouds on the wireless
horizon Indeed renewed signs of a slowdown in the US cellular
marketthe worlds largest in terms of absolute subscribershave
dampened the growth outlook for network operators and for handset and
infrastructure manufacturers  As Nokia Corp noted Dec  Despite improvement in Nokias
US mobile phone business growth and profitability in Nokia Mobile
Phones have developed somewhat below plan That sent the price of
Nokias American Depositary Receipts tumbling for the second time in
two months page   However it was unclear at press time whether handset
manufacturers in general faced a repeat of the overages that built up
in their US inventories during the  Christmas season
 All the same Wall Streeters are a notoriously fickle bunch and
any falloff in domestic wireless growth should be measured against
the blistering expansion that the US market enjoyed during  and
the first half of  Net subscriber additions simply could not be
sustained forever at such an explosive rate and cellulars longterm
growth pattern seems firmly intact  By the end of  it is conceivable that there will be 
million cellular subscribers in the United Statesa gain of 
million in a month span

 All Eyes Turn to PCS

 Big changes are destined to sweep the US wireless market this
year as the industry comes to grips with the probable enactment of
legislation aimed at deregulating telecommunications This would give
network operators the statutory certainty they need to move forward
with big purchases of new equipment said Matthew Flanagan president
of the Telecommunications Industry Association Arlington Va
 Moreover the US market is on the verge of entering a new phase
with the advent of broadband personal communications services PCS It may be another year yet before PCS is marketed on a large scale
but PCS licensees are betting big bucks that both lower price points
and the digitally enhanced sound quality of calls placed over their
systems will prove appealing to consumers who have disdained cellular
as too costly and to at least some cellular subscribers  This years challenges for PCS players will be to finish the US
licensing processthe Cblock spectrum auction see page  is set
to resume this weekand to bring newly licensed services to market
said Tom Mateer vice president of business development for Sprint
Telecommunications Venture STV the alliance of Sprint Corp and
three large cable television operators
 Our goal is to provide service in our own markets by the end of
 Mateer said of Kansas Citybased STV the largest of the AB
block major trading area MTA licensees in terms of potential market
population Other MTA licensees including ATT Wireless Services and
PCS PrimeCo LP are working against similar timetables
 While committed to code division multiple access CDMA as its
technology
standard STV had not named equipment vendors for its network
buildoutestimated to cost from  billion to  billion by industry
sourcesat press time Mateer said talks with prospective suppliers
were moving along
 Some funds from Sprints longanticipated deal to sell  percent
equity interests to France Telecom and Germanys Deutsche Telekom
which was approved by the FCC last month are expected to be earmarked
for STVs buildout
 On the narrowband side of PCS action will center on how
successfully competitors narrow the lead that Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp Mtel enjoys in this market For its part Mtel
continues to grapple with what Alex Brown  Sons Inc recently called
rollout concerns surrounding the companys SkyTel Way advanced
messaging service 
 Competition Consolidation and Convergence More of the Same
Only More So

 Perhaps the most important issue before the wireless industry is
how to compete effectively on a landscape that seemingly keeps
shifting beneath its feet For many wireless players achieving
scale is the way to maximize their competitive ability  This consolidation trend has been most pronounced in paging
where Arch Communications Group Inc and AirTouch Paging announced the
most recent acquisitions deals giving them about  million and 
million US subscribers respectively Suffice it to say that more
paging acqui sitions are in the offing this year
 But  will see the introduction of new wireless players as
well via corporate spinoffs For instance Sprints spinoff of its
Sprint Cellular subsidiary to shareholders WBF June   is on
track for completion late next month or early in March and ATT
Corps landmark breakup WBF Sept   is set to close by
years end
 Other wireless companies may become publicly held entities PageMart Inc the only privately held company among the top US
paging operators has hinted that it may go this route and London
financial circles are abuzz that Hutchison Wampoa of Hong Kong will
float Orange its UK personal communications network PCNpossibly
as part of a larger realignment of its telecom interests
 And the cast of characters getting into wireless seems likely to
keep on growing Two recent examples 
  A unit of International Family Entertainment Inc whose
chairman is evangelist Pat Robertson bought out the majority interest
held by Motorola Inc in Pakistan Mobile Communications Ltd licensed
to offer nationwide cellular service based on the global system for
mobile communications GSM standard as well as paging in the Asian
country
  Fidelity Capital part of the Bostonbased mutual funds giant
has helped engineer a deal aimed at strengthening specialized mobile
radio SMR operator Pittencrieff Communications Inc in its core
Texas market WBF May   Pittencrieff shareholders were to
vote late this week on the companys merger with Fidelityowned
Advanced MobileComm Inc
 Meanwhile convergence has continued to take on new and different
forms in wireless For instance there is the growing trend among
competitionminded service providers to establish themselves as one
stop shops  In the space of a week last month Dallasbased Paging Network
Inc PageNet announced marketing agreements with both STV and GTE
Corp giving PageNet new distribution channels for its digital and
alphanumeric services in both the PCS and local telephone markets
respectively  STV by packaging cable services on a promotional basis with its
planned service offerings for the local and longdistance telephone
markets appears to be seeking as many distribution sources as
possible STV also signed an agreement covering various text
messaging services with National Dispatch Center Inc a San Diego
based data network operator last month 
 Technology Its Show Time for CDMA iDEN

 Technology like competition is a powerful catalyst for
convergence The wireless industry should look during  for more
developments along the lines of these recent announcements
  Putting aside their intense rivalry Motorola granted LM
Ericsson AB a license to use Flex Motorolas highspeed paging
protocol in the Swedish companys pagers and infrastructure
equipment
  IBM Corp Nokia and the PCS subsidiary of Pacific Telesis
Group will work together on making wireless data services accessible
to subscribers via IBM ThinkPad laptop computers The ability to send
and receive email and facsimile messages and to gain access to the
Internet will be a key selling point for Pacific Bell Mobile Services
in marketing PCS in its service area of California and Nevada the
companies said
 But in the dynamic field of wireless technology the CDMA air
interfaceand its promise of offering  times the capacity of analog
cellularno doubt will command the limelight right through   The first CDMA system to achieve commercial status was
Hutchison Telecoms cellular service in Hong Kong last fall Next up
will be a longawaited cellular network built out in Los Angeles by
AirTouch Communications which has spent much time finetuning it
followed by the
mid launch of Shinsegi Telecommunications Incs cellular system
in South Korea WBF Aug  
 Importantly the  member companies of the CDMA Development
Group have verified test results done with CDMAs  kilobits per
second vocoder a touchstone to achieving wirelinequality voice
communications over CDMA networks  CDMA handsets for use on PCS networks are expected to become
available during the first half of  said Kevin Kelley vice
president of external affairs for Qualcomm Inc San Diego The
company plans to ship  million terminals this year
 For enhanced specialized mobile radio ESMR operator Nextel
Communications Inc CALL at least some of the questions
surrounding the sound quality of Motorolas ESMR technology known as
iDEN WBF April   will be resolved this year  Even while cementing its nationwide footprint in place with the
imminent completion of its acquisition of Dial Page Inc DPGE the
Rutherford NJbased company plans to conduct asinglemarket beta
test of what Nextel executives call reconfigured iDEN before the end
of March Based on the results the company will decide whether to
proceed with a more broadscale commercial introduction of the
technology Nextel disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange
Commission filing
 Meanwhile Geotek Communications Incwith a  million line of
credit provided by Hughes Electronics Corp at its disposal to acquire
additional  MHz spectrumwill begin commercial operation of its
own SMR service in Philadelphia its initial market this month
 Finally two companies developing interferencereducing cellular
filters that use hightemperature superconducting materials are bound
to make news Illinois Superconductor Corp is proceeding with
operational field trials while Superconductor Technologies Inc
announced the delivery of its second receiver filter subsystem for GSM
base stations last week

 International Asia Brazil Seen as Where the Action Will Be

 According to the Commerce Departments Office of
Telecommunications Brazil and India WBF Dec   will merit
close scrutiny from the wireless industry this year as emerging
markets with the greatest untapped potential
 Also noted agency analyst Stephanie McCullough cellular
competition will come to five countries for the first time South
Korea Taiwan Belgium Poland and Ireland The Czech Republic will
choose operators for two digital networks this spring and PCN
services may take shape in more European nations page 
 Three other Asian tigers also are likely to make waves in
cellular in 
 In China handset prices and user tariffs are projected to fall
spelling further rapid subscriber growth Having recently awarded
Ericsson its third infrastructure contract in  months Guangdong
Mobile Communications Corp soon will qualify as one of the worlds

LACK OF HANDSETS SEEN IMPEDING DUALBAND GSM SERVICES 
 Cellular operators that employ global system for mobile
communications GSM technology in their networks should think long
and hard about pairing their services with GSMs higherfrequency
counterparts DCS and PCS
 So says Toni Stadelmann deputy managing director of mobile
services for Swiss Telecom which has deployed a DCS personal
communications network PCN in Geneva to go with its nationwide GSM
cellular network  While its experience with PCN has been limited
the Geneva system was rolled out to coincide with the Telecom 
trade show and conference last Octoberthe PTT plans to introduce
DCS service in Zurich and Basel next fall as a capacityenhancing
supplement to  MHz cellular in these hightraffic markets
Stadelmann told the PCS in North America conference in Washington
last month
 In the long run he said the company hopes to reach roaming
agreements that would tie its PCN service together with Europes GSM
cellular operators and countries that either have PCN alreadythe
United Kingdom Germany and Franceor are contemplating PCN rollouts
including Sweden and Italy
 But there is one sizable problem Wireless equipment
manufacturers need to speed up efforts to bring dualband mobile
phones to market The subject of GSMDCS handsets also came up
during another recent meeting in Washington I dont know of any
vendor today committed to developing these handsets Malcolm Cowan
general manager of the Richardson Texasbased PCS business unit of
Northern Telecom Ltd told the PCS Strategies conference  If recent contract announcements are any indication however
Finlands Nokia Corp may be the first to take the plunge  The company has signed a twoyear contract with Telia Mobitel
the biggest GSM cellular network in Sweden for the delivery of base
station subsystems that can be used either for a standalone DCS
network or a seamless dualband service The base stations are
designed to bolster capacity in areas with heavy calling traffic as
well as to improve indoor coverage 
 Savings on Fixed and Operating Costs More Flexibility in Setting
Rates

 Nokias other recent GSMDCS infrastructure deals were with
NordicTel Holdings of Sweden and Sonofon of Denmark It also was the
vendor for Swiss Telecoms DCS system
 For Swiss Telecomscheduled to face competition in PCN beginning
in  when spectrum set aside for private operators will be opened
uppairing GSM and DCS will afford cost advantages in the areas
of infrastructure its transmission network and customer service and
billing Stadelmann said  According to an analysis in which the PTT assigned different
weightings to these cost areas potential savings of  percent can be
had percent on both transmission network and billingcustomer
service expenses and another  percent on infrastructure costs
 Moreover in limiting its PCN coverage to urban areas Stadelmann
said that Swiss Telecom has found that it can devise a rate structure
that offers greater appeal to the more priceconscious segment of the
wireless voice market
 By setting rates close to those of the wireline network Swiss
Telecom hopes to induce customers to switch over to PCN from the fixed
network for the mobility it affords But that of course first would
require a more robust roaming capability
 All Stadelmann could do last month was ask rhetorically What
are the manufacturers  doing He would like to see action sooner
rather than later

GLENAYRE NEXUS TEAM UP TO SUPPORT SPREADSPECTRUM TECHNOLOGY

 Glenayre Technologies Inc is considering plans to manufacture
receivers incorporating technology developed by Nexus
Telecommunication Systems Ltd which plans to market the technology
to paging operators aiming to address the low end of the twoway
messaging market
 The companies announced an agreement last month to collaborate on
integrating Glenayremade switches controllers and base stations
with Nexuss reversechannel receivers and twoway applications
platform  The deal is noteworthy because Glenayre will provide protocol
information on the companys GL advanced paging terminal that
would facilitate the operation of the twoway Nexus Network on
existing oneway paging systems  Besides possibly making Nexusbased receivers itself Glenayre
holds an option to buy them from Nexus as an original equipment
manufacturer In return Nexus granted the Charlotte NCbased
company the right to obtain a worldwide license on its returnchannel
technology

 US Beta Test Draws Near 
 Essentially the spreadspectrum Nexus technology WBF Nov 
 affords oneway paging carriers a lowspeed return channel Nexus Network uses the unlicensed  MHz band for the return
channel which operates at  bits per secondfar slower than ReFlex
or pACT the narrowband personal communications service PCS
protocols developed by Motorola Inc and ATT Wireless Systems
respectively
 Rani Cohen senior vice president of Givatayim Israelbased
Nexus said that Nexus Network is geared toward service offerings
where speed is not criticalmost notably a confirmation or short
messaging capability that would appeal to pricesensitive paging
subscribers
 A beta test of Nexus Network involving American Paging Inc and
several other US carriers is scheduled for next month Minneapolisbased American Paging holds five regional narrowband PCS
licenses  Samsung the South Korean conglomerate is expected to begin
shipping
twoway paging units supporting Nexus Network by next summer

MULTIPLE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS AND MORE ON THE WAY

 At the FCCs Dec  open meeting Chairman Reed Hundt hailed the
prospect of simultaneous spectrum auctions as a tremendous
accomplishment  And with good reason While the specialized mobile radio SMR
auction that began a month ago generally has moved along at a more
sedate pace the Cblock auction of bandwidth for broadband personal
communications services PCS kicked off with a bang on Dec  Net
high bids for the  Cblock licenses exceeded  billion by the
end of the fourth round
 One hopeful Puerto Ricobased PCS  LP offered an
astronomical  million in net high bids for basic trading area
BTA licenses in the first round skewing the bidding But the
hectic activity put to rest at least some doubts about whether the
longdelayed Cblock auction would measure up to last years PCS
auction of major trading area licenses
 Meanwhile SMR operators praised FCC plans to auction widearea
licenses for  MHz in contiguous blocks of   and  channels in
the  MHz band Also two notices of proposed rulemaking NPRMs
will allot still more spectrum for use in wireless applications if
adopted as final rules by the FCC
  One would open the  GHz band for pointtopoint
microwave operations BTA licenses would be auctioned offpossibly
as soon as a year from nowwith credits and installment plans
accorded to small businesses that wish to bid A provision would
permit the processing of pending license applications in the 
GHz band   The other NPRM would give hospitals access to vacant
television channels in the very and ultra highfrequency bands
doubling in many regions the number of frequencies available for
remote patient monitoring Higher power levels also would be allowed
for medical telemetry devices

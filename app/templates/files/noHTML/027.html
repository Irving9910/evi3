 INTRODUCTION

 During much of this century the mass media has
been characterized by a limited number of speakers
transmitting programming and information to essentially
passive audiences The communications medium of the twenty
first century  the Internet and cyberspace generally  is
changing that and will allow hundreds of millions of
individuals to engage in interactive communication on a
national and global scale never before possible The public
square of the past  with pamphleteering soap boxes and
vigorous debate  is being replaced by the Internet which
enables average citizens to participate in national
discourse publish a newspaper distribute an electronic
pamphlet to the world and generally to communicate to and
with a broader audience than ever before possible It also
enables average citizens to gain access to a vast and
literally worldwide range of information

 The Communications Decency Act quotCDAquot or the
quotActquot represents Congress first attempt to regulate
speech content in this promising new medium Unfortunately
Congress undertook this task without holding any hearings
regarding the likely impact of the CDA on that medium In
the name of protecting children from inappropriate material
they might encounter online Congress clumsily attempted to
graft regulations developed in the quotdialapornquot context onto
this very different indeed unique mode of communication 
 After making precisely the kind of inquiry Congress
failed to make  that is undertaking five days of
evidentiary hearings and considering massive amounts of
documentary evidence including extensive stipulated facts 
the threejudge district court below preliminarily enjoined
enforcement of provisions of the CDA that effectively ban
quotindecentquot and quotpatently offensivequot communications between
adults Appendix to Jurisdictional Statement quotJS Appquot
aa The district court unanimously held that
appellees are likely to succeed in their claim that this ban
violates the First Amendment

 That judgment was clearly correct Nevertheless
appellees appreciate that this case raises important
constitutional questions regarding the application of
traditional First Amendment principles to a new and
increasingly important medium of communication and therefore
recognize that the Court is likely to grant plenary review
regardless of the strength of the district courts decision Although we believe the judgment below could be summarily
affirmed we understand that in this case of first
impression the Court may prefer to engage in a more
comprehensive examination of this new medium and of the
extensive record compiled below We agree that in the
circumstances of this case plenary review may be
appropriate even if as we believe the judgment below is
plainly correct Accordingly we do not oppose the
governments request for plenary review

 However we do believe it is particularly important
in this case of first impression that the Court have a clear
understanding of precisely what was argued and decided below For example the government did not argue below as it
apparently does here that Sections aB and
dA of the CDA criminalize quotindecentquot or quotpatently
offensivequot speech only when the speaker knows that the only
recipients of the speech are all under  years of age Moreover the governments jurisdictional statement
frequently ignores dispositive findings of fact the
government does not argue are erroneous Accordingly we
submit this response in order to present a more complete
picture of what was and was not decided below

 COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE

A PlaintiffsAppellees in These Actions

 Appellees in these two consolidated cases represent
a broad and very diverse spectrum of content providers
service providers and users of content on the Internet The appellee content providers include individuals small
nonprofit organizations libraries book stores and other
speakers on the Internet The appellee access providers
include small or noncommercial quotInternet service providersquot
quotISPsquot as well as the worlds leading ISPs and commercial
online services

 Collectively appellees engage in or provide access
to an enormous variety of speech on the Internet eg
information about AIDS awareness classical and modern
literature political commentary and interactive discussions
on an array of topics All of this speech is appropriate and
constitutionally protected for adults and the vast majority
of this speech is appropriate and constitutionally protected
for most minors as well Nevertheless appellees engage in
or provide access to some speech that in some communities
could be considered quotindecentquot or quotpatently offensivequot Such
speech includes communications that contain the quotseven dirty
wordsquot found patently offensive in FCC v Pacifica
Foundation  US   information about sexual
issues and problems and images that depict sexually oriented
subjects

 Among this diverse group of appellee content
providers most do not charge money for the speech they make
available over the Internet some appellees provide and
charge for access to the Internet or to an online service Thus users around the world generally can access appellees
speech on the Internet free of charge Like other online
speakers appellees generally seek to make their speech
available to the broadest possible audience including
listeners within and outside of the United States

B The ThreeJudge District Courts Decision

 Appellants statement of the case entirely omits
any reference to or discussion of the extensive and unusually
detailed factual findings of the threejudge district court
that formed the foundation for the decision on appeal See
JS App aa The Jurisdictional Statement fails to
acknowledge the district courts critical factual findings
that  it is impossible or infeasible for most Internet
speakers to comply with the CDAs affirmative defenses 
because of the global nature of the Internet the CDA will
not effectively shield minors from indecent or patently
offensive speech since a very substantial percentage of such
speech is posted abroad and will not be deterred by the CDA
and  parents can use currently available software and
access provider options to control what Internet sites their
children may access These findings undergird the district
courts legal conclusions that the Act effectively bans
constitutionally protected speech among adults would not
substantially further the governments stated interest in
shielding minors from indecent online speech and is not the
least restrictive means available to serve the governments
interest

  Impossibility and infeasibility of compliance The district court received extensive evidence from numerous
experts and other witnesses and carefully considered the
different methods of communication over the Internet Based
on this body of evidence the court made its general factual
finding that quotonce a provider posts content on the
Internet it is available to all other Internet users
worldwidequot JS App a For most methods of
communication over the Internet the court concluded that it
simply is not possible for a speaker to restrict the
availability of his or her speech to adults

 For example the district court specifically
considered the ability of a speaker posting a message to a
USENET newsgroup to comply with the CDA The court found
that messages on newsgroups are quotdisseminated using ad hoc
peer to peer connections between approximately 
computers called USENET servers around the worldquot JS
App a and that the quotdissemination of messages to USENET
servers around the world is an automated process that does
not require direct human intervention or reviewquot id at a
a Because of this structure the court found as a fact
that quotonce a user posts a message to a newsgroup     that
message becomes available to all subscribers to that
newsgroup or bulletin boardquot Id at a As the court
below found content posted to newsgroups is quotavailable not
just in Philadelphia but also in Provo and Praguequot Id at
a The court specifically further found that quotindividuals
posting a message to a newsgroup    cannot ensure that all
readers are adultsquot Id at a emphasis added noting
that even the governments expert agreed with that factual
conclusion

 The district court reached the same conclusions
about email mail exploders also known as listservs chat
rooms and MUDs and MUSEs The court found as a fact that
there is quotno effective way to determine the identity or age
of a user who is accessing material through email mail
exploders newsgroups or chat roomsquot JS App a With
regard to mail exploders the district court specifically
noted that even the governments expert witness quotagreed that
no current technology could give a speaker assurance that
only adults were listed in a particular mail exploders
mailing listquot Id at a As with newsgroups and mail
exploders the court based its finding that individuals
quotengaging in chat room discussions cannot ensure that all
readers are adultsquot in part on the fact that the governments
expert agreed Id Similarly with MUDs and MUSEs the
court found as a fact that quotparticipants    do not know
whether the other participants are adults or minorsquot Id at
a

 With respect to the World Wide Web which is one
method of communication on the Internet the court found
that quotunlike other forms of communication on the Internetquot
JS App a there does exist quottechnology by which an
operator of a World Wide Web server may interrogate a user of
a Web sitequot using a computer program called a quotcgi scriptquot
id The court found as a fact however that content
providers who publish on the World Wide Web via the large
commercial online services cannot use cgi scripts Id For
those speakers on the Web there quotis no method currently
available    to screen recipients online for agequot Id

 The court concluded that all of the quotdefensesquot
advanced by the government below quotare effectively unavailable
for noncommercial notforprofit entitiesquot JS App a
and these entities constitute the majority of speakers on the
Internet See id at aa For example the distinct
court found as a fact that quotcredit card verification is
effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet
content providers as a potential defense to the CDAquot Id at
a The district court similarly considered the quotadult
verificationquot defense and found as a fact that the quotburdens
imposed by credit card verification and adult password
verification systems make them effectively unavailable to a
substantial number of Internet content providersquot Id at
a Finally the district court found as a fact that the
governments quottaggingquot proposal would not allow a speaker to
ensure that a listener is not a minor Id at aa

 Chief Judge Sloviter summarized the courts factual
conclusions as follows

 we have found that no technology exists which allows
 those posting protected but indecent material on the
 category of newsgroups mail exploders or chat rooms to
 screen for age Speakers using those forms of
 communication cannot control who receives the
 communication and in most instances are not aware of
 the identity of the recipients If it is not feasible
 for speakers who communicate via these forms of
 communication to conduct age screening they would have
 to reduce the level of communication to that which is
 appropriate for children in order to be protected under
 the statute This would effect a complete ban even
 for adults of some expression albeit quotindecentquot to
 which they are constitutionally entitled    

 Even as to content providers in the other broad
 category such as the World Wide Web where efforts at
 age verification are technically feasible through the
 use of Common Gateway Interface cgi scripts    
 the Findings of Fact show that as a practical matter
 noncommercial organizations and even many commercial
 organizations using the Web would find it prohibitively
 expensive and burdensome to engage in the methods of
 age verification proposed by the government and that
 even if they could attempt to age verify there is
 little assurance that they could successfully filter
 out minors

JS App a In their Findings of Fact the three judges
below found as facts that

 Many speakers who display arguably indecent content on
 the Internet must choose between silence and the risk
 of prosecution The CDAs defenses  credit card
 verification adult access codes and adult personal
 identification numbers  are effectively unavailable
 for noncommercial notforprofit entities

JS App a emphasis added 
  Ineffectiveness of the CDA The district court
also made specific factual findings demonstrating that
because a substantial percentage of all of the indecent or
patently offensive speech that is available on the Internet
is posted abroad the CDA will not be effective in its
claimed goal of preventing children from accessing that
material The court found that a quotlarge percentage perhaps
 or morequot of content on the Internet quotoriginates outside
of the United Statesquot JS App a and some of that
foreign speech is sexually explicit id As the court found
quotforeign content is otherwise indistinguishable from
domestic content as long as it is in English since foreign
speech is created named and posted in the same manner as
domestic speechquot Id Minors would have unfettered access
to all indecent or patently offensive speech posted abroad
and thus as Judge Dalzell concluded quotthe CDA will almost
certainly fail to accomplish the Governments interest in
shielding children from pornography on the Internetquot Id at
a

  Availability of user software to block or
screen material on the Internet Finally the governments
Jurisdictional Statement entirely omits any mention of the
extensive factual findings of the district court concerning
the variety of methods by which parents can easily and
inexpensively prevent their children from accessing indecent
or patently offensive online content even if posted
overseas The court identified many different and
currently available software programs that allow parents to
limit the Internet access of their children JS App a
a Similarly the court found that the major online
services all offer extensive options to allow parents to
control what their children can access Id at aa

 Given these factual findings which the government
has not contested it is clear that the threejudge district
court correctly held that plaintiffs had demonstrated a
likelihood of success on their claim that the challenged
provisions of the CDA violate the First Amendment

 ARGUMENT

I THE DISTRICT COURTS PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION SHOULD BE
 AFFIRMED BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT CONTESTED THE
 FACTS ON WHICH THAT INJUNCTION IS BASED AND DOES NOT
 ASK THE COURT TO OVERRULE THE LONGESTABLISHED FIRST
 AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THAT INJUNCTION IS BASED

 As noted the government does not argue that the
district courts findings of fact are arbitrary or otherwise
erroneous Nor does the government question the First
Amendment principles invoked by the district court Accordingly the government is simply challenging the
application of settled First Amendment principles to
undisputed findings of fact


 A The Government Does Not Question the District
 Courts Conclusion That the CDA Must Be Subjected
 to Strict Scrutiny

 The government does not dispute that the district
court appropriately subjected the CDAs contentbased
restrictions to strict scrutiny See Jurisdictional
Statement quotJSquot  Its sole argument is that the Act can
be upheld under strict scrutiny because the Act quotdirectly and
materiallyquot serves a quotcompellingquot government interest in the
quotleast restrictivequot way Id citing Sable Communications of
Cal Inc v FCC  US    Accord Turner
Broadcasting System v FCC  SCt    The government relies as it did below on its interest in
protecting children from quotpatently offensivequot and quotindecentquot
sexually oriented online material See JS App a
Sloviter J a Dalzell J

 But the government also invents a new interest
never advanced below  quotfurthering the First Amendment
interests of all parents and children in using what has
become an unparalleled tool for communicating and retrieving
informationquot JS  Without citation to the record
the government now asserts as if it were a matter of fact
that unless quotpatently offensivequot and quotindecentquot material is
suppressed at the speaker end quotmany parents will be deterred
from permitting their children to use the Internet indeed
many parents will be deterred from bringing the Internet into
their homes at allquot Id The government introduced no
evidence to support these assertions of fact And not
surprisingly the district court was not asked to and did
not make any such findings Thus nothing in the record
supports the assertion that the Act directly and
substantially furthers this newly coined interest 
 In any event it makes little difference what
interest the government now asserts in attempting to justify
the Acts ban on protected speech The district court
correctly concluded that the Act cannot survive the strict
scrutiny to which it must be subjected

 B The District Court Correctly Concluded That
 Appellees Had Established a Likelihood of Success
 on Their Claim That the Challenged CDA Provisions
 Are Facially Unconstitutional

 Although the government now attempts to separate
out and defend individually the three substantive provisions
of the CDA preliminarily enjoined by the district court this
is not how the case was argued and tried below To the
contrary the government made no attempt to distinguish
between the three provisions essentially conceding the same
First Amendment analysis applies to all three The entire
focus of the case  from the perspective of not only the
court but the parties as well  was the feasibility of the
CDAs defenses and the Acts patent overbreadth To the
extent any one provision received attention it was the
quotdisplayquot provision  USC  dB That
provision criminalizes the online display of patently
offensive material quotin a manner availablequot to minors The
vast majority of the speech criminalized by the CDA perhaps
 of the speech at issue in this litigation is
criminalized by that provision That provision
unquestionably violates the First Amendment as both the
threejudge court below and the Shea court unanimously
held

  The Display Provision Imposes a Criminal Ban on
 Constitutionally Protected Speech Contrary to Well
 settled First Amendment Precedent

 As the government essentially concedes the
challenged provisions of the CDA are clearly unconstitutional
unless the Acts defenses effectively enable online speakers
to communicate indecent or patently offensive speech to
adults See JS  That is so because this Court has
repeatedly held that government may not ban indecent speech
between adults in order to advance its interest in protecting
minors from that speech To the contrary quotgovernment may
not reduce the adult population    to    only what is
fit for childrenquot quotThe level of discourse reaching a
mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be
suitable for a sandboxquot and this is so quotregardless of the
strength of the governments interestquot in protecting
children Bolger v Youngs Drug Products Corp  US 
  emphasis added Government may not
constitutionally quotquarantine the general reading public
against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order
to shield juvenile innocence     Surely this is to burn
the house to roast the pigquot Butler v Michigan  US
   In Sable the Court cited Butler to
quotreiteratequot that point and stressed that a federal statute
is unconstitutional if it has the quoteffect of limiting the
content of adult communications to that which is suitable
for children    quot  US at  emphasis added See also Denver Area Educ Telecomm Consortium v FCC 
SCt    noting that quotno provision we
concede short of an absolute ban can offer certain
protection against assault by a determined childquot and
affirming that the Court has quotnot however generally allowed
this fact alone to justify reducing the adult population 
  to    only what is fit for childrenquot internal
quotations omitted id at  Kennedy amp Ginsburg
JJ concurring in part and dissenting in part same

 For this reason the governments entire case
hinges on the availability of the Acts defenses But as the
district court unanimously concluded based on its extensive
findings of fact which the government has not contested the
defenses simply are not available to the vast majority of
online speakers As a result the Act does effect a ban on
constitutionally protected speech between adults The
governments arguments to the contrary are based on factual
assertions that find no support in the record

 a First the government argues that the Acts
credit card and adult ID defense is available to the small
subset of online speakers who charge for access to their Web
sites  socalled quotcommercialquot providers JS  The
government introduced limited evidence that certain
commercial quotpornographersquot already use credit cards or adult
ID verification systems But as Judge Dalzell explained
these providers will be largely unaffected by the Act
precisely because they already require credit cards to obtain
access to virtually all of their posted content Even if the
Act were struck down commercial pornographers would continue
to require credit cards as they did before the CDA was
enacted because they do not want to provide their speech for
free To the extent they offer advertising quotteasersquot free of
charge the Act would require them to charge for those images
as well but the Acts vast burden on protected speech cannot
be upheld based on this minuscule subset of applications in
which the credit card defense could arguably be invoked See
JS App a Dalzell J Far from advancing the
governments interest quotin a direct and material wayquot Turner
 SCt at  such narrow application quotprovides only the
most limited incremental support for the interest assertedquot Bolger  US at 

 The governments suggestion that the district court
should have rewritten Section dB so that it would
apply only to these quotcommercial pornographersquot see JS 
contradicts the statutory text and clearly expressed
congressional intent As Judge Sloviter concluded below
quotit is clear from the face of the CDA and from its
legislative history that Congress did not intend to limit its
application to commercial purveyors of pornographyquot JS
App a Accord Shea  F Supp at  Unlike the
dialaporn restrictions upon which the CDA is purportedly
modeled the CDA is not by its terms limited to quotcommercialquot
speakers And the Conference Report confirms that Congress
intended quotcontent regulation of both commercial and non
commercial providersquot HR Conf Rep No  th Cong
d Sess   Indeed the Act is expressly made
applicable to quotlibraries and educational institutionsquot 
USC  e And Senator Exon the main sponsor of
the Act referred to newsgroups which contain primarily non
commercial speech as the principal target of the
legislation See  Cong Rec S daily ed June 
 The district court thus correctly declined to perform
the quotradical surgeryquot on the CDA the government suggests 
 Further the government ignores the district
courts factual finding that the credit card defense quotwould
impose a significant economic cost on noncommercial
entitiesquot JS App a Forcing speakers to require
credit card verification before providing access to their
speech would cause many speakers including many appellees
to quotshut downquot their Web sites Id Credit card
verification the court found also quotwould significantly
delay the retrieval of information on the Internetquot which
as the governments expert acknowledged would deter many
listeners from seeking access at all Id And it quotwould
completely bar adults who do not have a credit card and lack
the resources to obtain one from accessing any blocked
materialquot Id Based on the evidence the court concluded
that quotat this time credit card verification is effectively
unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content
providers as a potential defense to the CDAquot Id The
government has not challenged these critical findings

 b Ignoring the district courts express findings
to the contrary the government contends that noncommercial
Web sites can take advantage of the Acts defenses and
complains that the court did not adequately discuss the
availability of quotadult verification servicesquot such as
quotAdultCheckquot JS  The reason is simple The
government offered quotvery limited evidencequot regarding age
verification systems and even that limited evidence quotwas not
based on personal knowledgequot JS App a There was no
evidence how many persons are registered with such systems
or how reliable they are in screening by age Id There was
evidence however that adult verification systems are used
to the extent they are used at all only quotfor accessing
commercial pornographic sites which charge users for their
servicesquot Id Appellees and their potential listeners
obviously would not want to be associated with verification
systems that are used primarily if not exclusively to
access quotpornographicquot sites See Denver Area  SCt at
 quotwritten noticequot requirement will restrict cable
viewing by subscribers who quotfear for their reputationsquot if it
were disclosed they view quotpatently offensivequot material There are no such verification systems for the vast majority
of speech on the Internet including the speech of the
appellees in these consolidated cases The governments
contention now that such systems may be available as a
defense for commercial speakers who are not quotpornographersquot
and for the huge number of noncommercial speakers is thus
entirely unsupported by the record

 To the contrary the district court found as fact
that quotit would not be feasible for many noncommercial
organizations to design their own adult access code screening
systems because the administrative burden of creating and
maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs involved
is beyond their reachquot JS App a Indeed even some
quotcommercialquot entities could not afford to do so Id Moreover there was evidence that some Web users would not
retrieve information requiring credit cards or adult IDs Id Most importantly as the court found quotthe government
presented no testimony as to how such systems could ensure
that the user of the password or credit card is in fact over
quot Id at a The government has not directly
challenged and has certainly offered no basis for
overturning the district courts factual finding that quotthe
burdens imposed by credit card verification and adult
password verification systems make them effectively
unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content
providersquot Id

 c Finally with not a single citation to the
record or to the district courts findings the government
baldly contends that mail exploder chat room and newsgroup
users who want to disseminate patently offensive material to
adults can comply with the Act JS  This contention
is fatally undermined by the district courts factual
findings The court concluded based on the record evidence
that quotthere is no effective way to determine the identity
or the age of a user who is accessing material through e
mail mail exploders newsgroups or chat roomsquot JS App
a Indeed as the district court noted the governments
own expert agreed with those findings Id at a

 Despite its current speculation in the district
court quotthe government offered no evidence that there is a
reliable way to ensure that recipients and participants in
such fora can be screened for agequot Id emphasis added It is thus not surprising that the government ultimately
concedes that users of mail exploders newsgroups and chat
rooms who want to disseminate their constitutionally
protected speech will be forced by the CDA to quotswitch to an
alternative method of communicating that material over the
Internet or otherwisequot JS  But requiring speakers to
switch to an alternative method is patently unconstitutional
particularly since there is no realistic alternative in
terms of cost or audience reach to communication over the
Internet The government can no more single out a mode of
Internet communication for special bans or burdens than it
can single out one mode of the press See Arkansas Writers
Project Inc v Ragland  US    And
in any event the fact that speech can occur elsewhere cannot
justify a contentbased restriction Southeastern Promotions
v Conrad  US    Schneider v State 
US   

 Even more offensive to the First Amendment the
government suggests that quotusers of all three forms of
communication always have the option to tone down their
communication so that it does not contain materialquot
criminalized by the Act JS  In other words they can
selfcensor their speech in order to avoid federal
prosecution There could be no clearer admission that the
CDAs quotdisplayquot provision imposes a ban on the dissemination
of constitutionally protected speech 
  All Three Challenged Provisions Fail Strict
 Scrutiny Because They Do Not Directly and
 Substantially Advance Any Compelling Government
 Interest

 In any event even if the majority of Internet
speakers could utilize the CDAs defenses and they cannot
the Act would still fail strict scrutiny for the independent
reason  not addressed by the government here  that
because of the global nature of the Internet the Act cannot
and will not directly and substantially further the
governments stated interest The district court found as
fact that quota large percentage perhaps  or more of
content on the Internet originates outside the United
Statesquot JS App a accord Shea  F Supp at  The government conceded below that some of the speech posted
abroad would violate the CDA JS App a and it is likely
that at least  of all speech criminalized by the Act
originates outside the United States

 Moreover the subset of indecent and patently
offensive speech the government found most troubling and
asserted is the focus of the CDA  namely sexually
oriented visual images  is generic and largely fungible Its country of origin is irrelevant From the perspective of
its potential interest to andor effect on minors a photo of
a nude woman posted in Denmark is no different from a photo
of a nude woman posted in the United States And both are
equally available to every American home connected to the
Internet As the district court concluded quotpornography
from say Amsterdam will be no less appealing to a child on
the Internet than pornography from New York Cityquot JS App
a Dalzell J Because foreign speakers will have
little or no incentive to comply with the Act quotthe CDA will
almost certainly fail to accomplish the Governments interest
in shielding children from pornography on the Internetquot Id See also Shea  F Supp at  concluding that the CDA
quotwill not reach a significant percentage of the sexually
explicit material currently availablequot

 In fact if the Act were upheld thus criminalizing
domestic speech that would simply quotencourage American
pornographers to relocate in foreign countries or at least
use anonymous remailers from foreign serversquot JS App
a n Dalzell J

 Under strict scrutiny and even under intermediate
scrutiny the government must demonstrate that the Act quotwill
in fact alleviate the harms it is meant to prevent in a
direct and material wayquot Turner  SCt at  The
CDAs inability to regulate foreign speakers precludes any
such showing See eg Denver Area  SCt at 
quotPartial service of a compelling interest is not narrow
tailoringquot Kennedy amp Ginsburg JJ concurring in part
and dissenting in part Florida Star v BJF  US 
  holding that Florida law prohibiting
disclosure of rape victims names in quotany instrument of mass
communicationquot but not by other means did not directly and
substantially further the laws stated purpose Smith v
Daily Mail Publishing Co  US   
invalidating law making it a crime for newspaper but not
electronic media to publish the names of juvenile
offenders see also Bolger  US at  restriction that
quotprovides only the most limited incremental support for the
interest assertedquot cannot pass muster under commercial speech
standards As Justice Scalia explained in Florida Star quota
law cannot be regarded as    justifying a restriction upon
truthful speech when it leaves appreciable damage to the
governments supposedly vital interest unprohibitedquot 
US at  Scalia J concurring

 This fundamental shortcoming of the Act exists
regardless of whether the online communication is
specifically and intentionally directed to minors or is
simply displayed in a manner available to them in either
event the CDA will not shield minors from foreign
originating material The Acts ineffectiveness is therefore
a separate and independent reason for affirming the district
courts preliminary injunction as to all three of the CDAs
substantive restrictions regardless of how broadly or
narrowly they are construed See pp  infra

  The Act Fails Strict Scrutiny Because There Are
 Less Restrictive Means to Achieve the Governments
 Stated Goals 
 Underlying the governments argument is a single
premise  that without the Act minors would be left quotwholly
unprotectedquot JS  See also id at  arguing that
there is quotno other effective way to vindicate the
governments compelling interestsquot But that premise is
simply not true Indeed it is completely undermined by the
district courts findings of fact based largely on
government stipulations 
 The district court concluded that quotmarket forces
exist to limit the availability of material online that
parents consider inappropriate for their childrenquot JS
App a n The district court made extensive factual
findings regarding the availability of quotsoftware that is
intended to enable parents and other adults to limit the
Internet access of childrenquot Id at a The court noted
that quotthe market for this type of software is growing and
there is increasing competition among software providers to
provide productsquot Id The court went on to make specific
findings regarding two such products Cyber Patrol and
SurfWatch Id at aa The court also found that all of
the major commercial Internet access providers  America
Online AOL Microsoft Network CompuServe and Prodigy 
quotoffer parental control options free of charge to their
membersquot and made specific findings regarding those parental
control mechanisms Id at aa Each of these findings
was based on facts stipulated by the government

 The court also discussed PICS the quotPlatform for
Internet Content Selectionquot which has developed quottechnical
standards that would support parents ability to filter and
screen material that their children see on the Webquot Id at
a PICS provides the ability for third parties as well as
individual content providers to rate material Parents can
then screen their childrens Internet access based on the
rating system they choose Indeed they can screen out all
speech that has not been affirmatively identified as
appropriate for children by a rating bureau the parents
trust Id These findings too were stipulated by the
government

 Based on these stipulated facts and the additional
evidence it heard at trial the court concluded that
quotcurrently available userbased software suggests that a
reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent
their children from accessing sexually explicit and other
material which parents may believe is inappropriate for their
children will soon be widely availablequot JS App a

 As Judge Dalzell explained these software tools
afford parents options to protect their children from online
material they deem inappropriate JS App a But even
without such software quotparents can supervise their
childrens use of the Internet or deny their children the
opportunity to participate in the medium until they reach an
appropriate agequot Id The government can support parents by
educating the public about the quotbenefits and dangers of this
new mediumquot Id See Denver Area  SCt at 
concluding that quotinformational requirementsquot together with
support for user based blocking is a more narrowly tailored
means of limiting minors access to patently offensive
material on cable than is speaker based blocking

 In other sections of the CDA Congress determined
that user based blocking mechanisms are the most appropriate
means of regulating content including indecency on
broadcast television In Section  of the Act Congress
directed television manufacturers to equip their products
quotwith a feature designed to enable viewers to block display
of all programs with a common ratingquot  the socalled quotV
chipquot Sec c Congress then encouraged the broadcast
industry to develop a rating system Sec b and
expressly stated federal policy to encourage the
establishment of a quottechnology fundquot to support the
development of userbased blocking technology and public
education Sec  The fact that Congress has chosen these
significantly less restrictive means to protect minors from
indecent material in broadcast television further supports
the district courts holding that the Act is not narrowly
tailored See Denver Area  SCt at  unexplained
decision to use quotsignificantly less restrictivequot means to
shield minors from quotpatently offensivequot material on regular
cable channels demonstrated that restrictions applicable to
leased channels is neither the quotleast restrictive
alternativequot nor quotnarrowly tailoredquot 
 C The NonDisplay Provisions of the CDA Preliminarily
 Enjoined by the District Court May Pose Different
 Questions If They Are Construed As the Government
 Now Apparently Construes Them on Appeal

 The government did not argue below that Sections
aB and dA only criminalize the
transmission of quotindecentquot or quotpatently offensive materialquot
when the speaker knows that the only recipient of the
communication is under  years of age The government now
contends for the first time that Section aB
quotapplies only in situations in which a person transmits
indecent material to another person knowing that person is
under quot JS  emphasis added If we understand the
government correctly it is now interpreting Section
aB to apply only when the only recipient of a
communication is known to be a minor 
 Below all parties assumed that Section
aB could and would be interpreted to criminalize
any indecent communications using a telecommunications device
when the speaker knew or had reason to believe that any
recipient of the communication would be a minor Since every
content provider on the World Wide Web for example knows 
in the sense of being virtually certain  that some
recipient of the message will be a minor Section
aB creates the same constitutional problems
barring speech between adults in order to shield minors from
the same speech as the display provision Accordingly it
is not surprising that the district court applied the same
First Amendment analysis to the nondisplay provisions and
unanimously concluded that the quotplaintiffs have established
a reasonable probability of eventual success in the
litigation by demonstrating that  aB and
a of the CDA are unconstitutional on their face to
the extent that they reach indecencyquot JS App a Although the government now asserts that the display
provision and the other provisions quotrequire separate
analysisquot JS  it did not urge any separate analysis
below See note  supra Based on the arguments that were
made to the district court its conclusion regarding
 a was clearly correct

 The government also now for the first time
interprets Section dA as applying only to
quotsituations in which a person sends indecent material to
someone he knows to be under quot JS  It is not at all
clear that this is a tenable interpretation of Section
dA which unlike Section aB does not
expressly impose a scienter requirement regarding age If we
understand the government correctly it is now interpreting
Section dA to apply to a communication with
specific persons where the speaker knows that the only
persons receiving the message are minors

 Below all parties assumed that Section
dA could and would be interpreted to reach any
quotpatently offensivequot communication knowingly made using an
interactive computer service where the speaker sent the
message to specific persons  such as by email or mail
exploders  as opposed to methods of online communication in
which the speaker merely makes his speech available to anyone
who wants to access it such as through the World Wide Web Under this interpretation Section dA imposes
virtually the same restrictions on adulttoadult
communications as does the display provision and presents
the same constitutional problems Not surprisingly the
district court unanimously concluded that quotSections d
and d of the CDA are unconstitutional on their facequot JS App a Based on the arguments made to the district
court this conclusion was clearly correct

 In summary the display provision clearly violates
the First Amendment because it bans quotpatently offensivequot but
constitutionally protected speech between adults As
understood and argued below the other provisions suffer from
the same infirmity If the government is now definitively
and officially construing those other provisions to apply
only when the speaker knows that the only recipients of the
speech are minors this Court should not itself undertake to
review ab initio the constitutionality of these newly
coined provisions Instead it should allow the district
court to reassess those provisions on remand in light of the
governments new position 
 CONCLUSION

 Although the judgment below was plainly correct
and would warrant summary affirmance because this is a case
of first impression involving application of First Amendment
principles to an important new medium of communication
appellees do not oppose the governments request for plenary
review

 The CDA was enacted as Title V of the Telecommunications
Act of  Pub L No     Stat  
 and will be codified at  USC  ah

 Appellees did not challenge the application of the CDA to
obscenity child pornography and unlawful child
solicitation and the courts order does not reach those
applications See JS App aa

 Subsequently another threejudge district court
addressing a separate and somewhat narrower challenge to the
CDA unanimously reached the same conclusion See Shea v
Reno  F Supp  SDNY  The government has
filed a jurisdictional statement in Shea No  urging
this Court to hold Shea pending resolution of this case Appellees agree that is the proper approach

 We note that the government has not urged summary
reversal We note also that the plaintiffsappellees ACLU et
al in the consolidated case have moved for summary
affirmance Obviously appellees in this case would welcome
that resolution and our belief that the Court would probably
prefer plenary review should not be understood as casting any
doubt on the strength of that motion

 The plaintiffsappellees in this case American Library
Association Inc et al v United States Department of
Justice et al are the American Library Association
Freedom to Read Foundation America Online Inc Society of
Professional Journalists The Microsoft Network LLC
Newspaper Association of America Association of Publishers

 Thus user based blocking is far more effective than the
speaker based blocking required by the CDA because only user
based blocking will prevent minors from accessing the
substantial percentage of all indecent speech that is posted
abroad And unlike speaker based blocking which effectively
prohibits adults from gaining access to the blocked speech
user based blocking enables parents to gain access to the
speech themselves while denying access to their children

 Two judges also concluded that the CDA is
unconstitutionally vague In particular Judges Sloviter and
Buckwalter agreed that the terms quotindecentquot and quotpatently
offensivequot quotin contextquot are so vague as to violate the First
and Fifth Amendments JS App a Sloviter J aa
Buckwalter J These judges were clearly correct
notwithstanding this Courts distinguishable decision in
Denver Area Educ Telecomm Consortium Inc v FCC 
SCt   however because the district courts
decision can and should be affirmed on the basis of its First
Amendment holding there is no need for the Court to reach
the vagueness issue

 The government wisely has not resurrected its argument
suggested but not seriously urged below that an
quotintermediate scrutinyquot standard drawn from FCC v Pacifica
Found  US   might be appropriate instead Clearly such a standard is not applicable here where there is
no plausible analogy to the spectrum scarcity of broadcast
the Internets characteristics are the antithesis of the
scarcity that underlies the Pacifica standard See Turner
 SCt at  refusing to extend Pacifica standard to
cable television Sable  US at  same regarding
dialaporn services Nor is the Internet characterized by
the pervasiveness and intrusiveness the Pacifica Court found
noteworthy about broadcast As the district court found
accessing online content requires several affirmative steps
quotcommunications over the Internet do not invade an
individuals home or appear on ones computer screen
unbiddenquot JS App a Moreover quotalmost all sexually
explicit images are preceded by warnings as to the contentquot Id Thus as the governments witness admitted quotthe odds
are slim that a user would come across a sexually explicit
site by accidentquot Id

 In the context of strict scrutiny the Court should
consider only the precise interests the government identified
and urged below as the justification for the law it should
not credit new interests advanced only on appeal and as to
which the court below had no opportunity to take evidence or
pass upon Cf Edenfield v Fane  SCt  
 In any event the government cites no legal support
and there is none for the proposition that assisting parents
or children to use the Internet is a quotcompellingquot government
interest

 Indeed as the government itself notes JS  the
evidence shows that the number of minors gaining access to
the Internet is rapidly increasing And to the extent
parents are concerned about their childrens access to
inappropriate materials the district court found that user
based technological tools are available to assist them in
imposing restrictions JS App a

 See note  infra and accompanying text

 Below the governments only specific argument regarding
 USC  a was relegated to a footnote quotThe
specific basis for plaintiffs challenge to section a is
unclear In the absence of a specific showing as to how this
provision is applicable and might be in violation of the
Constitution it should not be enjoinedquot Defendants
Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for a Temporary Restraining
Order Feb   at  n The government made no
specific arguments below regarding  USC  dA
and otherwise referred to  USC  a and d
together throughout its papers

 The government tacitly acknowledges the weakness of its
argument that Section dB can survive strict
scrutiny when it states that the constitutional issues posed
by that provision are quotmore difficultquot than those posed by
Sections a and dA JS 

 Sable Communications v FCC  US at  quoting
from Bolger v Youngs Drug Products Corp  US  
 which in turn quoted from Butler v Michigan 
US   

 Thus this bedrock principle has already been applied in
the context of sale or distribution of immoral books and
other printed materials Butler use of the postal service
to mail unsolicited commercial advertisements about
contraceptives to homes Bolger and use of the telephone to
sell sexually explicit communications Sable

 If as the government has suggested the CDA was
principally aimed at commercial providers of online
quotpornographyquot Congress could have passed a statute aimed
specifically at that activity Cf Zauderer v Office of
Disciplinary Counsel  US    government
may not enact a broad prophylactic rule quotsimply to spare
itself the troublequot of distinguishing speech that is the
subject of legitimate regulatory concern from speech that is
not

 There was no evidence that the amount of indecent and
patently offensive speech as a percentage of the whole
varies depending on its country of origin

 For the same reason the CDA will not directly and
substantially further the governments newly found interest
in expanding access to the Internet Because foreign
quotpatently offensivequot and quotindecentquot online material will
remain available to their children parents under the
governments theory will continue to be deterred from
permitting their children to use the Internet

 Of course even under this interpretation the provision
could still senselessly and indeed unconstitutionally
outlaw a college professors communications concerning Lady
Chatterlys Lover or Moll Flanders for example to a student
known to be under

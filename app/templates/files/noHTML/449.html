Subject Re US Intelligence in the Indian subcontinent

An open question for all I am interested in any information available
on CIA and other US intel agency operations in INDONESIA

All kind of data would be greatly appreciated as would any information
on specific cases on US intelligence involvement in the area

Or if anyone have any links about itjust let me know

Best

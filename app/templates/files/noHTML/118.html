 A Refining of the Ability to Tell the Truth 





 A REFINING OF THE ABILITY

To tell the truth



by Marc Lebovitz





They were on a collision course and Lucia Cordell Getsi was only a small child



It was at an early point in her childhood when the intelligent
independent adventurous Tennessee girl and the magical illuminating world
of books met headon at the William H and Edgar Magness Community House
and Library in the Middle Tennessee town of McMinnville It probably came
as no surprise to those who knew her that the second child of Sam and
Georgia Cordell flung herself enthusiastically into reading None of her
ventures were or are halfhearted



As a small child I decided that I needed to be stronger so I would carry
these large boulders around the Illinois State University Distinguished
Professor of English recalls And when I decided I had to cure myself of
vertigo which Id had since I was seven I started to climb the faces of
cliffs near my home No ropes no tools no nothing It was terrible but I
thought I needed to get over my fear Id get to the top and then lie down
and crawl back to the edge like a snake and make myself look overfor
hours



When she characteristically made up her mind to know everything there was
to know in the world she pitched camp in McMinnvilles library and became
a library fixture With a ruler she measured the stacks of books she would
read making sure she completed at least a foot of books per week She
eventually knew every shelf in the Magness Library and became aware that
knowledge was larger than the library only when she perused a read shelf
and discovered a new book had appeared



She loved horse books dog books Nancy Drew books and books her mother
didnt want her to read such as Forever Amber and Inherit the Wind She
read books at the library at school during church sermons on the porch
sitting in trees and at night under her bed blanket with a flashlight
until morning



For all the literary world gave to Lucia Cordell Getsi she has admirably
and sufficiently repaid as an adult She has published five volumes of
poetry and translations as well as poems fiction translations and
critical essays in  or  refereed journals Among the writing awards she
has won are the Capricorn Prize for the book of poems Intensive Care the
Ann Stanford Prize a Pablo Neruda Prize a Bread Loaf Scholarship a 
National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship three Illinois Arts Council
Fellowships and numerous grants and awards for The Spoon River Poetry
Review which she edits



Even more important Getsi shares her passion for the written word with
students from elementary school through college graduate school and with
the general public of all ages Her public school poetry workshops public
lectures and public readings of her works have ignited interest and
enjoyment in poetry throughout the United States



There is a bittersweet irony to the physical and mental fitness
conditioning young Lucia put herself through because she was barely out of
her teens when both capacities were put to the test Her mother a strong
intense and deeply religious woman committed suicide just days after
Lucias st birthday Exactly  years later in  Getsis
yearold daughter Manon contracted the deadly and paralyzing
GuillainBarr syndrome After many months of hospitalization followed by
rehabilitation therapy Manon recovered although she continues to be
vulnerable to other ailments



Those traumatic experiences plus her other life experiences and
observations have played a key role in Getsis poetry Manons illness
resulted in Getsi writing the awardwinning Intensive Care the creation of
which served as an outlet for Getsis anger and frustration and also
allowed her to be a proxy for Manons thenstill voice She admits that
being able to write about the experience in a way helped save her own
life



Books were young Lucias lifeline to other worlds her escape from
smalltown Tennessee and an endless source of experiences and information
At various times in her life she thought the information was her own Once
as an adult she cut open an infected wound on a horses leg squeezed out
the bad blood and had her daughter Manon lead the horse to stand in the
creek each day for a week until the water healed the wound The horse
survived It wasnt until about a year later while reading the classic
book My Friend Flicka to Manon that Getsi discovered that her intuitive
knowledge used to help the horse actually came from the pages of that
book which she had read and reread as a child



But Getsis real memories experiences observations and emotions are
ingredients that produced the awardwinning poet author editor and
professor she is today at Illinois State University Although her careers
as an educator and as a writer have been distinguished for years the
honors have been particularly frequent in recent years She was the 
Poet of the Year in Illinois the same year the University named her an
outstanding researcher and last November Gov Jim Edgar presented her with
the Governors Award for the Arts in the individual artist category



She graduated magna cum laude in English from Middle Tennessee State
University and has masters and doctoral degrees from Ohio University She
had NDEA and teaching fellowships at Ohio and studied for one year in
Germany on a Fulbright scholarship Her first book was a translation of the
complete works of Austrian expressionist poet Georg Trakl followed by
books of poetry titled Bottleships For Daughters Teeth Mother Letters
and No One Taught This Filly to Dance



Intense personal experiences have not only been the subjects of her
writing but the insight Getsi gained during those experiences and
throughout her life continue to invigorate her poetic juices But
experiences and emotions and observation dont make the poetry write
itself Getsi spends countless hours on each work and particularly enjoys
the opportunity to focus only on poetry while in residencies such as last
summers residency at the Ragsdale Foundation in Lake Forest



When Im at a writers colony or on a grant all I do is write she
says I can obsess about one poem for weeks if I want to Often Ill
write one humongous poem and then the filtering starts There are huge
baths of imagery thought context emotions that wash over the original
images thoughts and ideas I started with Poetry is the kind of art that
needs long spaces of time to think and to create and just allow the fluid
movement of images to wash over the whole paradigmatic axis of memory the
whole memory self



Thats what grants such as from the National Endowment for the Arts permit
artists to do But now the stupid totalitarian people who are scared of
ideas and who want the world their way have had their way with the NEA and
its basically gone she says



To write a book of poetry takes usually five to  or  years but
Intensive Care was an exception It took me from  to about  or 
When I first started writing those poems it was very cathartic The poem
Nursing was written when I was in such a rage I was so angry the kind
of anger where you think you are going to melt I was angry at the entire
medical profession angry at nurses who couldnt spell or remember to cover
Manons stomach with the lead shield during the  chest X rays



During Manons first months of hospitalization none of her bodys systems
were working including her ability to speak She communicated by spelling
words Not vocally but by having her mother or a nurse recite the alphabet
out loud while she indicated by blinking letter by letter the words she
wanted to communicate A nurse who either could not spell or who did not
want to make the effort to communicate Manonstyle moved Manons headset
which the paralyzed teenager used to call for the nurse out of reach of
her headthe only body part she could move at that time As a result Manon
could not alert the doctors that her feeding tube was twisted and she was
in great pain and long overdue for a pain shot Her mother discovered the
problem the next morning She addressed the nurses in Nursing see page




There were wonderful nurses too of course she recalls but the poem
was cathartic in dealing with those bad ones Some of the other poems in
the book were ways of funneling unresolved things from my life through that
experience That experience cast a new light on those unresolved things
the kind of light that makes meaning in life That kind of making meaning
is what makes us human



Manon still weeps at her mothers public readings from Intensive Care and
to this day there is still one poem that Getsi cannot read aloud without
choking a little The book for her is my experience of her illness she
says It is a mirror she can look back into because blessedly she did
not see herself in the mirror during that time At the time she looked as
though she would not survive and I did not let her see that



Although she continues to bring poetry to classrooms in Illinois and
elsewhere Getsi cant hide her disappointment in the state of reading
especially reading poetry these days



Poetry just isnt there in the schools she says It isnt in public
schools it isnt in the libraries it isnt even much in the bookstores
except for specialized bookstores Anything that requires lonely
concentration is not in the schools anymore Its not a financial issue
its just unnatural to our contemporary culture to be silent But poetry
grows out of that silence As a result poetry now has been marginalized
and hidden



Reading during childhood particularly reading poetry can introduce
children to a new worlds of information and insight and experience that can
ultimately inspire them to explore their own ideas and feelings Children
Getsi firmly believes need poetry and art and music and drama and all the
arts in their lives as early as possible in order to have the greatest
benefit throughout theirlives But the great power of poetry is nowhere to
be found in too many American schools



Ninety percent of the teachers in elementary and high schools dont know
where to go to find poetry Ive been to hundreds of school libraries where
they dont have books in the library only audiovisual equipment or
computers Most school libraries dont have poetry especially elementary
school libraries Its because students arent expected to go in and read
and if they do go in they dont read poetry because they havent been
exposed to it Ive been to some of the best schools in our state to do a
poetry workshop and have had students who have never read a poem They
might get a Hallmark card with what is called poetry on it and thats what
they think poetry is What do you do Getsi asks



I cant tell you how many times Ive received calls from teachers who ask
about my poetry outreach program a small outreach program I run through
Spoon River Poetry Review who say Poetry is the field I feel most unsure
about most uncomfortable teaching I tell them they dont have to teach
poetry they dont have to know everything about a poem before teaching it
All they have to do is enjoy it and let students enjoy it Just put the
poetry out there



The program is free to the schools but they have to do it under my
conditions three weeks devoted to nothing but poetry in the English
classes she says We use a Spoon River Poetry Review poet and I try to
feature two poets a year with an Illinois connection so I have an endless
supply throughout the state



The only thing I want to come out of it is that students have a
fantastically wonderful integrating experience with poetry They
accomplish something learn something new get excited about it assimilate
it accommodate it and are changed by it and they are different people
when I or my assistant walk out of their room I want the students to have
an experience that imprints so deeply that they will associate the
experience with language with poetic language and with poetic form
forever They know it is something called poetry and they can access that
world any time they want easily I teach them the access points the
literary bookstores the small presses now the Internet how to get the
books and what books to look for



Lest anyone get the impression that the absence of poetry in the schools
tempts her to quit bringing poetry to the younger set Getsi brims with
hope and excitement when she tells about the students in the K class she
met in Granville Illinois or the very atrisk teenagers attending a
special Los Angeles school that serves as their last chance at a high
school diploma



In her discussions about poetry with all those groups Getsi sometimes uses
prints of paintings of horses by German artist Franz Marc as a basis for
imagery I use Franz Marcs works because they always have weird stuff in
them that cant be explained she says I ask the students to walk into
the picture and describe what is happening I ask them to describe shapes
and to step in and out of the painting and to walk around the horses in the
picture The assignment is to write a communal poem which everyone
contributes to and which ends up many pages long before it gets whittled
down see page 



And that is a complete experience Getsi says They brought their whole
world into it and put another world into that whole world and have taken
that enriched world and galloped to wherever they think they are going back
to But theyll never get back to it because these are changed little
people Theyll never look at art the same way or a horse the same way
That is the secret power of art



Its about imagination and the ability to imagine she says Television
and movies steal our ability to imagine and thats a killer for poetry
Without the ability to imagine you cant really read but you particularly
cant read poetry Unless you can picture in your mind everything that
passes in front of you in a poem you get nothing out of it I cant teach
students to write until I teach them how to think metaphorically in an
imagebased way



The kids in LA were kids who had seen everything pregnancy drugs
guns death They really wanted to go to this school although its very
hard and if they dont stick with it they are out I laid out the
paintings and we started talking about them They are very smart kids with
wonderful language skills The poetry they wrote spoke volumes to me All
their hope and unjaded idealism came pouring through



Getsis mother was descended from Braxton Bragg a brilliant Civil War
general who is blamed in part for the Souths defeat because of his failure
to take advantage of the victory of his Army of Tennessee at the Battle of
Chickamauga



I see those fanatically obsessive brilliant moody characteristics on
that side of the family and I have been obsessive off and on about a lot
of things in my life Getsi admits But Ive channeled it differently
redistributing aspects of my personality Writing helps to rechannel
things because it requires an intense paying attention to things and
requires a selfhonesty That could be an illusion but I really think it
does



You are very aware when you are writing of when you are lying
Truthfulness is not easy It really is very difficult she says The act
of writing is a refining of the ability to tell the truth the need to tell
the truth Only the artist knows how very difficult it is to be truthful



Quotation taped to Getsis Stevenson Hall office door Artistic growth is
more than it is anything else a refining of the sense of truthfulness The
stupid believe that to be truthful is easy only the artist the great
artist knows how difficult it isWilla Cather



People are hungry today with their selfhelp books and natural health and
tai chi and meditation and yoga and all this kind of stuff Getsi says
But the nourishment they need is available to them through literature
They just have to take the time to access it You cant read a poem like
you read a newspaper because it is all the invisible stuff all the stuff
youre not reading that is whats important and it takes time for that to
come forward



Getsi recalls a personal example of the nourishment and enjoyment that
comes from literature in general



My Friend Flicka is about the relationship between love and death and
between insanity and genius It is a magnificent novel that had a profound
influence on me as a child especiallythe loveanddeath and
madnessandgenius motifs I saved that horses life in Tennessee but I
didnt know I had learned it from that book until I read it with Manon



One time Manon her first stepfather and I were reading the book out
loud in the car on the way back to Normal from the stable in Decatur where
our horses were stabled We were reading and couldnt stop when we got to
our driveway she says It was the climax of the novel and three of us
were sobbing The boy in the novel had been up all night caring for the
horse who had been badly injured by barbed wire and was all infected and
about to die from this terrible fever It is a powerful description of love
as a life force and of what it feels like to begin to die of the process
of death In fact its an exact description of what I went through with
Manon



But in the story there is a transference and the fever goes to the boy
who becomes sick with pneumonia and is delirious He hears a shot and
thinks his father has shot his horse Actually the father had shot a
cougar The boy wakes up six months later and finds that Flicka is alive
and fine Flicka is the anima of this little boy it is his female side
his creativity Its a complex amazing novel



Well we clambered back into the house still reading the whole time
sitting on the floor for another  minutes all of us sitting there
sobbing as we finish the book We werent a bit embarrassed Incredible
Jeez How many times does that happen when a family can share that kind of
emotional experiencesafely



Nursing
by Lucia Cordell Getsi


above all you must
feel
the fear the terror
of helplessness the loneliness
of being alien altered in strange
mirrors in a world
shrunken
to a bed where time measures in pain
shots
you must decode
the politics of powerlessness
and administer
words
like drugs to hope with more
lifesustaining than feeddrips
to the stomach or respiration
to flattened lungs words pressed
like rarest wines precious as bloods
of saints fermented in the chambers
of your own heart you must give
along with everything else
or else
you will have murdered
because you did not
love your work enough




The Big Blue Horses in Autumn
after Franz Marcs The Large Blue Horses

I am watching the big blue horses
Mymother watches with me These horses
are plump like blue plums like blue
beach balls like balloons
that could float to the red hills
or like blue tennis balls about to go over
the net The horses are peaceful
swatting flies one horse nuzzles

with his muzzle the heart

of the sun like a sunbeam
that dips from the sky Im going
to ride the biggest blue horse Mother
hand over hand Im going to climb
up that sunbeam and land
on his soft pillowy back
and the horse will canter me up the sunbeam
over the round hill

maybe through golden clouds

to home

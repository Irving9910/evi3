Student Report Seven


This is it folks Endeavor lands tomorrow and were going home either tomorrow or Wednesday What a long strange trip its been 

Yknow weve been writing these things for a week and a half now and I wonder if anyone has been reading them Im going to post our EMail addresses at the end of this so that if you get the urge  to say hi to ask further questions or just to tell us that you read these things  you can 
Yesterday was Aarons airground link with Endeavor and well let him speak up later First yesterdays report talked a lot about the outside of JSC which is interesting but kind of superfluous The really incredible stuff is whats IN the buildings

You already know about the Clean Rooms Mission Control and EOL The only other place that weve got personal experience with is Building Eight Half of building eight is the onsite medical facility The other half the half weve used has video and photo labs and a computer set up to print photos from laser disk 
Ive got to diverge from my divergence for a bit to tell you about the photos An average shuttle mission comes home with three to five thousand frames of photographic film from cameras high enough quality that they can take detailed Earth pictures from orbit These pictures are all developed numbered cataloged according to latitude  longitude main visible features etc This information is stored in a database at JSC called sseopjscnasagov which is public access NASA also publishes laser disks which contain several tens of thousands of shuttle photos apiece which makes it slightly easier to find lets say the photos from STS roll  frame 

Thats the only other building that we know from personal experience However weve been told about a lot of incredible stuff which hopefully well get to see once the shuttle has landed Theres a building which is set up to run simulations in Mission Control It has the capabilities to feed data into Mission Control that exactly replicates a shuttle mission and they can go through any number of anomalies to see how well the ground crew is prepared for them Unless you have participated in a simulation youre not allowed through Mission Control unescorted during a mission

Astronaut training goes on here and I assume theyve also got the standard battery of equipment that youve seen in The Right Stuff However Im told that they have a full array of VR equipment The American government is just about the biggest user of VR in the world for just such applications like this The equipment they use today probably saves them thousands of dollars per astronaut in materials used for training 
A slight divergence and then well go to Aaron If anyone out there in Netland is interested in working on a shuttle mission this is for you STS  the second SRL mission is flying in August By then we would like to have a network of people across the country or even across the world if possible online to JSC during the mission If any of these people knew of anything interesting going on in their area flooding fires anything major that could be seen from space and might make a difference to the radar theyd write in to us with a report of what they knew where they were any and all information that they thought pertinent Our information here is limited by what gets put on the Net or in the newspapers If its something like a volcano eruption or an earthquake were not likely to get any information until its over and while aftermath is probably interesting it doesnt give us any more information about the way the world works So if youre interested in helping out a shuttle mission write to either Aaron or Jon

And now to wrap up the series heres Aaron with what happened last night


STOP THE PRESSES Before Aaron says a word weve forgotten to thank the six most important people in the entire mission


Thank you Shuttle Commander Sidney Gutierrez

Thank you Mission Specialist Michael Clifford

Thank you Pilot Kevin Chilton

Thank you Mission Specialist Thomas Jones

Thank you Payload Commander Linda Godwin

Thank you Mission Specialist Jay Apt


These six are the astronauts who served aboard the Endeavour weve been leaving out the u in Endeavour all week Oops for STS the Space Radar Laboratory It was their incredible dedication and hard work that enabled this mission to go so spectacularly smoothly And we almost forgot to thank them Shame on us Now back to our regularly scheduled report


Here we go To start out I was talking to Linda Godwin the Payload Commander It was kind of neat because I also talked to her once before last summer at JPL No particular amenities were exchanged the format of our conversations with the crew are a long comment then several smaller comments with space for response I told her about how I worked two years ago in the field on the upper peninsula of Michigan on one of the sites that they have imaged I told her about what an incredible experience it was getting away from a science class to do something like that or like working at JSC The feeling is absolutely different Learning on the job like this is incredible What Im doing matters and that makes all the difference in the world If something goes wrong in a high school physics class nobody cares Here when someone asks you to find something out and they need it in an hour for the shuttle flyby you dont get a chance to do it over And you do NOT fail If you did screw up I dont really think that anyone would care they plan for that and it happens But thats not what happens You do it You do the best job possible And if it involves learning some radar science or meteorology or computer science well thems the breaks

I love it

Anyway once I got done with that I noted that I had been wondering how different the training had been for this mission as opposed to her others and she was nice enough to oblige me by telling me Pretty much the same thing happened when I wondered what differences she noticed in the state of the world between yesterday and a week before that All in all it was fun and informative and I got a real kick out of talking to the shuttle


OK folks heres where we get off Its been fun  we all learned a little and nobody got hurt I hope that youve enjoyed reading these things as much as weve enjoyed writing them We encourage correspondence  thats how you learn and learnings how you grow

Spaceborne Imaging RadarC and XBand Synthetic Aperture Radar SIRCXSAR is part of NASAs Mission to Planet Earth The radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time regardless of weather or sunlight conditions SIRCXSAR uses three microwave wavelengths Lband  cm Cband  cm and Xband  cm The multifrequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing The SIRCXSAR data complemented by aircraft and ground studies will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity SIRC was developed by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory XSAR was developed by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for the German space agency Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten DARA and the Italian space agency Agenzia Spaziale Italiana ASI with the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luft und Raumfahrt evDLR the major partner in science operations and data processing of XSAR

What is Cold Numbers
Cold Numbers is a fan created set of cards for On the Edge When a number of us learned that the expansion formerly known as Wetworks TEFKA WW was put on hold by Atlas Games we decided to
satisfy our need for new cards ourselves The name was spawned from the subject of a letter from John Nephew explaining why TEFKA WW wasnt possible Anyone have a copy of that letter
There is a mailing list on which we discuss the set You can subscribe to it by sending a message to
macjordomofenrisitsilstuedu with an empty subject
line and Subscibe coldnumbers YourRealName in the first line of the message
Alternatively you can deal with a real human being at 
MrsBrinkerfenrisitsilstuedu
The digests of the list are stored at  the digest storage
depot
All the cards so far designed can be found at the 
Cold Numbers Web Page

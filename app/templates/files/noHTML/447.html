 WASHINGTON  Why did President Bill Clinton meet with Grigori
 Loutchansky a man whose company the current CIA director has
 told Congress is an organization associated with Russian
 criminal activity

Who knows I guess there always might be some nefarious conspriatorial
reason But my first guess would be this sloppy staff work in the way
that Reagans Bitburg visit turned into a fiasco and numerous other gaffs
and faux pas have been made Given that there was already according to
the article an investigation going on concerning this fellow and
information about him in the press I cant imagine anyone associating
himherself with such a person especially if there were something
conspiratorial going on

More likely is the fact that this guys name registered on a whos who
list of possible contributors in his particular ethnic community and the
GS or whatever special assistant and there are LOTS of them or maybe
even an intern put him on the list which then went up the food chain to
the higher reaches of the admin part of the Adminsitration where someone
with some actual authority who has about  things to do glances at it
for  seconds and says yeah thats fine

Of course I could be wrong

Lets do a little thought experiment

Lets imagine that in France Russia or some other
major nation someone is seeking the job of chief
analyst of American politics This person is given this
news story and asked to produce a report on its
significance using all the latest information
technology and best relevant data

Would the analysis that the contact was probably a
bureaucratic SNAFU without any larger political
significance get the analyst the job

I dont know This is just a question to produce a
thought or two

I have no opinions about the news story other than to
notice that it is possibly interesting and that the
facts should be filed away for future reference and
crossreferencing The issues to which the facts
pertain are highly strategic

I think your last sentence hits it on the head The new nuclear
problems out of the old USSR have indeed gotten short shrift In fact
last year there was a bit of a scandal regarding Germanys BND and what
may have been a setup to sting such people as Loutchansky might be The
main significance is that there is clearly a market for this and when you
combine it with what I think David Huff was pointing out in his earlier
post on mininukes it does serve to lower ones comfort level

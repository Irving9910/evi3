December Moonwatch

 Full Moon 
Dec  at pm in Cancer
Dec  at am in Sagittarius
 Certain times each month are poor times to make major decisions or purchases These are the times when your purchases turn out to be something you never wear or use They are also disastrous times to hold important meetings
When the Moon is void of course we become like floating balloons of helium and cant trust our decisionmaking skills because we are not grounded Whatever we initiate during these times tends NOT to fulfill its purpose
Keep an eye on the times listed in this column
 DURING THESE TIMES

dont begin anything important
dont make major purchases
dont make important plans
expect shortages delays and goofups

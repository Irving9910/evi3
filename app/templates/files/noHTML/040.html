SIRC Description
What is SIRCXSAR

SIRCXSAR stands for Spaceborne Imaging RadarCXband Synthetic Aperture
Radar SIRCXSAR is an imaging radar system scheduled for launch aboard the
NASA Space Shuttle in  It consists of a radar antenna structure and
associated radar system hardware that is designed to fit inside the Space
Shuttles cargo bay On takeoff the cargo bay doors are closed as seen in the
graphic on the next page After the Space Shuttle has reached a stable Earth
orbit the cargo bay doors will be opened  the antenna structure will be
deployed and SIRCXSAR will be switched on to begin using its
stateoftheart radar technology to image the earths surface Radar images
generated by SIRCXSAR will be used by scientists to help understand some of
the processes which affect the earths environment such as deforestation in
the Amazon desertification south of the Sahara and soil moisture retention in
the MidWest

The SIRCXSAR Project

SIRCXSAR is a joint project of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration NASA the German Space Agency DARA and the Italian Space
Agency ASI It is the next step in a series of spaceborne imaging radars
beginning with SEASAT in  continuing with SIRA  Germanys
Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment  and SIRB  It is a precursor
to the Earth Observing System EOS imaging radar system planned for the end of
the decade 

Science Objectives

SIRCXSARs unique contributions to Earth observation and monitoring are its
capability to measure from space the radar signature of the surface at three
different wavelengths and to make measurements for different polarizations at
two of those wavelengths SIRC image data will help scientists understand the
physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar images at just one
wavelengthpolarization such as those produced by SEASAT Investigators on the
SIRCXSAR Science team will use the radar image data from SIRCXSAR to make
measurements of the following


Vegetation type extent and deforestation
Soil moisture content
Ocean dynamics wave and surface wind speeds and directions
Volcanism and tectonic activity
Soil erosion and desertification



SIRCXSAR Instrument Description


The SIRCXSAR antenna structure actually consists of three individual
antennas one operating at Lband cm wavelength one at Cband cm
wavelength and the third at Xband cm wavelength The Lband and Cband
antennas are constructed from separate panels that can measure both horizontal
and vertical polarizations



The SIRCXSAR antenna is the most massive piece of hardware at a total of
 kilograms ever assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and measures
 meters by  meters The SIRC instrument was built by JPL and the Ball
Communication Systems Division for NASA and provides the Lband and Cband
measurements at different polarizations The Lband and Cband antennas employ
phased array technology which allows the antenna beam pointing to be adjusted
electronically The XSAR instrument is built by the Dornier and Alenia
Spazio companies for DARA and ASI and operates at a single frequency Xband
The XSAR antenna is a slotted waveguide type which uses a mechanical tilt to
change the beam pointing direction 


SIRCXSAR Image Data

During a weeklong Shuttle flight SIRCXSAR will image an area of roughly
 million square kilometers of the Earths surface This corresponds to a
total of  hours of data The peak data rate will be  megabits or
 bits per second The data collected will be processed into images
with resolution selectable from  to  meters The width of the area mapped
out by the radar will vary from  to  kilometers depending on how the radar
is operated and the direction in which the antenna beams are pointing Data
from SIRCXSAR will be used to develop automatic techniques for extracting
information from radar image data in preparation for the EOS SAR mission later
in the decade

More About SIRCXSAR

The Shuttle Imaging RadarC and XBand Synthetic Aperture Radar SIRCXSAR
is a cooperative space shuttle experiment between the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration NASA the German Space Agency DARA and the Italian
Space Agency ASI The experiment is the next step forward in NASAs
Spaceborne Imaging Radar SIR program that began with the Seasat Synthetic
Aperture Radar SAR in  and continued with SIRA in  and SIRB in
 The program will eventually lead to TOPSAT a mission to measure
topography globally and the Earth Observing System EOS SAR later in this
decade The program also benefits from experience gained with the Magellan
Mission to Venus other international spaceborne radar programs eg ERS
JERS and prototype aircraft sensors such as the JPL Airborne SAR
AIRSAR

SIRC will provide increased capability over SEASAT SIRA and SIRB by
acquiring digital images simultaneously at two microwave wavelengths
lambda L band lambda   cm and Cband lambda   cm
These vertically and horizontallypolarized transmitted waves will be received
on two separate channels so that SIRC will provide images of the magnitude of
radar backscatter for four polarization combinations HH
Horizontallytransmitted Horizontallyreceived VV Verticallytransmitted
Verticallyreceived HV and VH and also data on the relative phase
difference between the HH VV VH and HV returns This allows derivation of
the complete scattering matrix of a scene on a pixel by pixel basis From this
scattering matrix every polarization configuration linear circular or
elliptical can be generated during ground processing The radar polarimetric
data will yield more detailed information about the surface geometric
structure vegetation cover and subsurface discontinuities than image
brightness alone 

Germanys imaging radar program started with the Microwave Remote Sensing
Experiment MRSE flown aboard the Shuttle This Xband radar was flown on the
first SPACELAB mission in  The program was continued by development of
the XSAR for which cooperation with Italy was initiated XSAR will operate
at Xband lambda   cm with VV polarization resulting in a
threefrequency capability for the total SIRCXSAR system Because radar
backscatter is most strongly influenced by objects comparable in size to the
radar wavelength this multifrequency capability will provide information
about the Earths surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with
previous singlewavelength experiments

SIRCXSAR Instrumentation

SIRC will provide multifrequency multipolarization radar data The SIRC
instrument is composed of several subsystems the antenna array the
transmitter the receivers the datahandling subsystem and the ground SAR
processor The antenna is composed of two planar arrays one for Lband and
one for Cband Each array is composed of a uniform grid of dualpolarized
microstrip antenna radiators with each polarization port fed by a separate
corporate feed network The overall size of the SIRC antenna is  x 
meters and consists of three leaves each divided into four subpanels 

Model of the SIRCXSAR antenna



Unlike previous SIR missions the SIRC radar beam is formed from hundreds of
small low power solid state transmitters embedded in the surface of the radar
antenna By properly phasing the energy from these transmitters the beam can
be electronically steered in the range direction deg from the nominal
deg off nadir position without physically moving the large radar antenna
This feature will enable images to be acquired over a wide range of incidence
angles 

XSAR will provide VV polarization images using a passive slotted waveguide
antenna measuring  x  meters Other XSAR components include a
traveling wave tube as transmitter an exciter receiver and data handling
subsystem A mechanical tilt mechanism will point the XSAR antenna to angles
between  and deg in the same direction as the Lband and Cband beams


Both SIRC and XSAR can be operated as either stand alone radars or together
Roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle will allow data to be acquired on either
side of the shuttle nadir ground track The width of the imaged swath on the
ground varies from  to  kilometers  to  miles depending on the
orientation of the antenna beams and the operational mode Table  presents a

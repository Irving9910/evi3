Interferometry  Fort Irwin California
Fort Irwin California

This image of Fort Irwin in Californias Mojave Desert compares interferometric radar signatures topography  data that were obtained by multiple imaging of the same region to produce threedimensional elevation maps  as it was obtained on October   by the Spaceborne Imaging RadarCXband Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour Data were acquired using the Lband  centimeter wavelength and Cband  centimeter wavelength The image covers an area about  kilometers by  kilometers  miles by  miles North is to the lower right of the image The color contours shown are proportional to the topographic elevation With a wavelength onefourth that of the Lband the results from the Cband cycle through the color contours four times faster for a given elevation change Detailed comparisions of these multiple frequency data over different terrain types will provide insights in the future into wavelengthdependent effects of penetration and scattering on the topography measurement accuracy Fort Irwin is an ideal site for such detailed digital elevation model comparisions because a number of high precision digital models of the area already exist from conventional measurements as well as from airborne interferometric SAR data

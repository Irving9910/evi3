America Online AOL already under fire from  state attorneys general for the way it has implemented its new pricing is now getting legal heat from at least one of
its own subscribers

An AOL subscriber has filed a classaction suit in New York Supreme Court against the online service claiming that the its policy of automatically switching subscribers from their  per month pricing plan to the  plan violates New York state law

The suit filed by Stephen DiLorenzo a New York resident and AOL subscriber represented by Bragar  Wexler argues that the policy violates states laws against deceptive trade practices The suit asks the court to declare that AOL is engaging in deceptive practices under the states law and seeks  million in damages
 The suit comes at a time when AOL is negotiating with the attorneys general from  states and one territory over the pricing plan

On Friday AOL resolved the complaints of an th stateWashingtonwhen it agreed to allow members to pick their pricing plan from an opening splash screen that shows up when users log on

But the agreement apparently did not appease the other attorneys general who are continuing to negotiate with AOL Nor did it apparently resolve those of
DiLorenzo

AOLs new pricing plan is slated to take effect after December  when the members billing cycle begins It will automatically replace the current plan that gives users five hours of service for  a month with a flatrate plan that provides unlimited service for  per month Under the current plan users pay  for each additional hour a pricing scheme that has cost many users a lot more than 

Many members have applauded AOLs move to provide unlimited access for  but the way AOL has implemented the new prices has come under fire from legal experts and users alike

Critics say that AOL should have asked users to choose whether they wanted the new plan rather than being switched automatically AOL will allow users to retain their current pricing if they go to the New Pricing area on AOLan area users say is difficult to findand select the current plan But everybody else will start being charged  as of their billing date in December

Because of the Washington agreement AOL users now are presented with a choice to switch to the  plan or choose other options when they log on The new screen will mention the  plan on the second screen Anyone who doesnt log on in before their December billing date theoretically might not know about the new pricing until they get their next bill

This part where users will be upgraded to the higher priced plan if they happen not to log on is what DiLorenzo is characterizing as deceptive marketing

AOL would not immediately comment on the suit

Getting in Touch

From friendly hugs to fullfledged passion physical contact helps
keep us healthy Thousands of alternative healthcare providersfrom
chiropractors to massage therapistsswear by the healing
power of touch Dr Theresa Crenshaw a San Diego physician and
sex therapist credits it with a broad range of physical and emotional
benefits ranging from providing a sense of comfort to boosting
the immune system and stabilizing blood pressure Although the
body of scientific evidence proving the benefits of touch is still
slim the consequences of touch deprivation are well documented

Decades of studies on newborns and the elderly reaching back
to the s have shown physical and mental suffering from lack
of touch even if all other basic needs were met Touch
deprivation is just as destructive to health as lack of vitamin
C says Dr Crenshaw and just as easy to remedy

Hemp Comeback

Liberal Senator Lorna Milne introduced an amendment to a bill
that will replace the Narcotic Control Act If approved the
amendment will make it legal to cultivate some forms of marijuana
or hemp by adding mature hemp stock to a list of
approved substances

Compared with marijuana cigarettes industrial grades of hemp
have only a tiny fraction of the level of THCthe substance
that produces a high when smoked Before it was outlawed in 
hemp was used for thousands of years to manufacture a wide variety
of productsfrom ropes and sails to shirts shoes and even
salad oil

Environmentalists say a domestic hemp industry could reduce destructive
logging practices by replacing woodbased pulp in the papermaking
process Its also a very very viable alternative
crop for tobacco on some of the lands in southwestern Ontario
that really can grow very little else said Milne
